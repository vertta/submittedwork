Given the provided data, what are three conclusions that we can draw about crowdfunding campaigns?
•	The most successful campaigns were launched in June and July dropping by  a small margin  in August . We could make the assumption that the reason for the success during those month are when schools are not in session  but we would need more data to prove this assumption.  
•	The theater, film & video and music are the most successful categories   with specifically plays being the most funded subcategory. 
•	Music and Film video were the second and third highest successful category.
•	It is interesting to note that radio and podcasts were about equally successful and unsuccessfully
What are some limitations of this dataset?
•	Size of the data set 
•	Locations of where the campaigns were launched
•	Demographics and Income could pay a factor into the type of data generated by the campaign
•	What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create, and what additional value would they provide?
o	Creating a pie chart for the percentage of which category was successful which could give an instant visualization of which campaign would need to be dropped or revised for future planning
o	Line chart under to denote incremental succession for one or more campaigns over the course of each month
